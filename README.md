# bears-v-babies

Implementation of an online Bears versus Babies[1] game. Work in progress.


### Vision

Anyone can start a game server with
```
python server.py
```
and returns a code.

Anyone with the code can then connect to the server with
```
python client.py [code]
```

### Completed

1. Game
2. Server networking using python socket mainly complete, including the communitation protocalls.
3. Client sending complete. Clients can download but the downloaded data are yet to be processed.
4. Basic prototype level security. Numbers are **very** small and simple algorithms used for testing purposes.
5. Write server and client programs.
6. Implement the GUI for the client.
### TODO

1. Debug and test
2. Improvements

### References

In progress.
